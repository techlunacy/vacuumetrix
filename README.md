vacuumetrix
===========

Sucks up metrics from various external sources and puts the data into internal systems. 
This is a good thing to do because whilst all the external SAAS services we use are fantastic, it's also sometimes very useful to be able to be able to view and manipulate the data in one place.  For example, we might want to make a single graph with some internally generated application metrics, with some perfomance metrics from New Relic, with some metrics from an AWS Elastic Load Balancer.  Perhaps.  Anyway, vacuumetrix is a collection of ruby scripts that talk to various APIs and allows the collection of this data in one place.

#Running the scripts
The scripts are in the bin directory and are designed to be run from cron every minute.
Generally if no argument is supplied to the script it'll grab all the metrics.  If an argument is supplied it'll be more specific.

cron:
<pre>
*	*	*	*	*	/opt/vacuumetrix/bin/NewrelicEnduser.rb 123 metricyouwant
</pre>

##NewrelicEnduser.rb
(Note:  If you haven't already done so you will need to activate the New Relic REST API.  See here: http://blog.newrelic.com/2011/06/20/new-data-api/
Get New Relic End User (RUM) stats.  Supply two args, app and metric.  

##NewrelicThresholds.rb
Get the threshhold values for all your applications.  This includes average RAM, CPU, DB etc.

##AWScloudwatchEBS.rb
Get EBS metrics.  No arguments.  Run every 5 minutes. No point running more frequently.

##AWScloudwatchELB.rb
Get Elastic Load Balancer metrics.  Supply the name of the ELB or multiple ELBs and and optionally --start-offset and --end-offset (in seconds).

##AWScloudwatchRDS.rb
Get RDS metrics.  Optionally supply the name of the Relational Database Service instance. (Tested with MySQL).  YMMV.

##AWScountEC2.rb
Count the number of EC2 instances of each flavor.  No arguments.

##AWScloudwatchElasticache.rb
Get Elasticache metrics.  Interesting ones anyway.  No arguments.

##AWScloudwatchDynamo.rb
Get DynamoDB metrics. Specify table_name as argument and optionally --start-offset and --end-offset (in seconds). 

##Neustar.rb
Get Neustar Web Performance Metrics.  For each monitor get duration and status for each monitored location.  No arguments.  Run every 5 minutes.  (Not very efficient at the moment.  Needs some tuning).

##facebook.rb
Argument is the name of the page you want to check the like count of. 

##twitter.rb
Argument is the name of the twitter user you want to check the number of followers of. 

#TODO

##Suck in

* Other AWS metrics 
* Google Analytics

##Spit out
